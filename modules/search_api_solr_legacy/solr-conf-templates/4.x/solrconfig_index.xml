<!--
  The config generator will add more stuff here automatically if
  required by your drupal setup. Having these field types in a separate file is
  better than modifying schema.xml.
-->
  Don't use the config XML templates directly. Use the config generator to get
  your individual config files. Use the "Get config.zip" button in the UI or
  drush solr-gsc my_solr_server
  See INSTALL.md for details.
